      <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I have little experience with JavaScript and HTML. I did a six week
        summer intensive program called "All Star Code" where I learned more
        about web development, and how to implement JS into websites.

      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I have experience in customer service. I worked for a month as a cashier
        in my aunts hardware store. However, not only was I a cashier, I also
        helped customers around the shop get their desired items.
