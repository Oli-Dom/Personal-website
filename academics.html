          When I was in the Dominican Republic I attended the private school
          called "Notre Dame School. I was there from k-7th grade. They had
          events such as science fairs <br />
          where kids are divided into groups and do scientific research which
          then later on they have to present in front of judges. The school also
          had international fairs, an event where kids do <br />
          research about a country and dress up in that coutry's traditional
          clothing, and also have to expose to judges. I was part of the Honor
          Society as well.
